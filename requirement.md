- [ ] **The Window Management**

  - [ ] able to switch to another window
  - [ ] able to minimize the window
  - [?] able to remain content adjusted accordingly, when change of the resolution of window(?)
  - [ ] able to close the window and quit the program cleanly by
    - [ ] pressing ESC key
    - [ ] clicking on the cross on the window's frame

> **❗: Testing on Linux is needed, only have done testing in macOS.**
